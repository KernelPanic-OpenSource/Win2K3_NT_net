/* Security fix: To elevate the access requirement, the "access" bits in IOCTL codes have been changed 
                 from FILE_ANY_ACCESS to FILE_WRITE_ACCESS. IOCTL codes are not only passed from user 
                 mode to kernel mode, but also in remote control requests and replies. In the case of 
                 remote control, this change breaks backward compatibility with NT 4.0 & Win 2k clients 
                 since they use FILE_ANY_ACCESS. To overcome this problem, we decided 
                 that the IOCTL codes in remote control packets will continue to use FILE_ANY_ACCESS. 
                 This means that we will have two formats for IOCTL codes: a local (user mode <-> kernel mode) 
                 format that uses FILE_WRITE_ACCESS and a remote control format that uses FILE_ANY_ACCESS.
                 The following macros perform the conversion from one format to another. 
                 They are used
                 1. Just before sending out remote control requests in apis (wlbsctrl.dll)
                 2. Immediately after receiving remote control requests in driver (wlbs.sys)
                 3. Just before sending out remote control replies in driver (wlbs.sys)
                 4. Immediately after receiving remote control replies in apis (wlbsctrl.dll)

   Note: If, in the future, the "access" bits of IOCTLs are changed again, it is also necessary to modify the
         SET_IOCTL_ACCESS_BITS_TO_LOCAL( ) macro.
