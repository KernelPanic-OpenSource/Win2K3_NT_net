# NOTE: Though we have the source code in .\pbasetup, pbasetup isn't in this list.
#       Instead, it's being built and checked in as a binary.  Pbasetup needs to
#       exist only in x86 form, because it goes into PBAinst.exe (which is x86-only).
#       'pbasetup{x86}' doesn't work because non-x86 builds would break in postbuild
#       because pbasetup.exe was missing.
