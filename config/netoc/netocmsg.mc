;Notes:
;
;    Important:
;    ----------
;    This file contains the resource strings that will be displayed
;    in message boxes and used for event logging as well. We can't put
;    all the string resources here, because message resources carry an 
;    additional CR/LF pair on the end, making it tricky when we point
;    directly to it through SzLoadIds().
;
;    Also take note of the severity of the message, because this will
;    determine with which icon the message is displayed or logged.
;    To avoid accidently using a string resource for event reporting,
;    all messages must have a severity of either information, warning 
;    or error. If not, you will get an assertion.
