   Cluster control routines:

   The following routines can be used to control individual cluster hosts or the
   entire cluster, both locally and remotely. They are designed to be as generic
   as possible. Macros, defined above, are designed to provide simpler
   interfaces for particular types of operations.

   It is highly recommended to make all response arrays of size WLBS_MAX_HOSTS
   to make your implementation independent of the actual cluster size.

   Please note that cluster address has to correspond to the primary cluster
   address as entered in the WLBS Setup Dialog. WLBS will not recognize
   control messages sent to dedicated or additional multi-homed cluster
   addresses.

 * Function: WlbsQueryState
 * Description: This function is a logical extension of WlbsQuery, which can be used
 *              to query state from an NLB cluster other than the conventional membership
 *              list and convergence state.  Retrievable state includes the driver-
 *              resident NLB parameters, the state of a BDA team, the state of a given
 *              port rule and the packet filtering decision for an arbitrary packet.
 * Parameters: IN cluster - cluster IP address or WLBS_ALL_CLUSTERS for all clusters.  For a 
 *                          IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_BDA_TEAMING operation, which is global to ALL NLB
 *                          instances on a given host, the cluster should be WLBS_ALL_CLUSTERS.
 *             IN host - host's dedicated address, priority ID, WLBS_DEFAULT_HOST for current default
 *                       host, WLBS_ALL_HOSTS for all hosts, or WLBS_LOCAL_HOST for local operation.
 *                       For IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_BDA_TEAMING and IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_PARAMS operations, which
 *                       can only be performed locally, the host should be WLBS_LOCAL_HOST.
 *             IN operation - one of IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_BDA_TEAMING, IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_PARAMS,
 *                            IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_PORT_STATE or IOCTL_CVY_QUERY_FILTER.

 *                               OPTIONS sub-structure for that operation.  
 *             OUT pResonse - a pointer to an array of WLBS_RESPONSE structures that will be filled-in
 *                            at the successful completion of the request.  The array should be long 
 *                            enough to hold the maximum number of unique responses (one per cluster
 *                            host), which is bounded by WLBS_MAX_HOSTS.  Only responses for which 
 *                            there is room in this array will be returned; all others will be discarded.
 *             IN/OUT pcResponses - a pointer to a DWORD that contains that length of the WLBS_RESPONSE
 *                                  array on the way in and the number of successful responses received
 *                                  on the way out.
 * Returns: DWORD - one of:
 *              WLBS_INIT_ERROR - an initialization error occurred.
 *              WLBS_REMOTE_ONLY - the operation can be performed ONLY remotely.

 *              EXACTLY match that which NLB is expecting.  For example, if a 
 *              notification for an IPSec session is given, then NLB expects the 
 *              protocol ID to be 50 (ESP) and the ports to be the UDP ports used
 *              in the IKE negotiation over UDP.
 * Parameters: IN ServerIp - the server IP address of this connection, in network byte order.

 *             OUT NLBStatusEx - the NLB-specific status of this request, as follows:
 *                 WLBS_OK, if the notification is accepted.

 * Description: This function notifies the NLB kernel-mode driver that a connection,
 *              or session, as defined by the caller of this function, is being 
 *              closed immediately.  This interface is reference counted and must be called 
 *              the same number of times that the connection-up interface was called
 *              for this particular connection (that is, the number of Downs + Resets
 *              must be equal to the nubmer of Ups).  If N connection-up notifications 
 *              are given, N connection-down/reset notifications are necessary to remove
 *              the state that NLB creates to track this connection.  The semantics of
 *              the information provided here must EXACTLY match that which NLB is expecting.  
 *              For example, if a notification for an IPSec session is given, then NLB 
 *              expects the protocol ID to be 50 (ESP) and the ports to be the UDP ports 
 *              used in the IKE negotiation over UDP.
 * Parameters: IN ServerIp - the server IP address of this connection, in network byte order.
 *             IN ServerPort - the server port (if relevant) of this connection, in network byte order.
 *             IN ClientIp - the client IP address of this connection, in network byte order.
 *             IN ClientPort - the client port (if relevant) of this connection, in network byte order.
 *             IN Protocol - the IP protocol of this connection.  Support protocos = IPSec (50).
 *             OUT NLBStatusEx - the NLB-specific status of this request, as follows:
 *                 WLBS_OK, if the notification is accepted.
 *                 WLBS_REFUSED, if the notification is rejected (e.g., if the cluster is stopped)..
 *                 WLBS_BAD_PARAMS, if the arguments are invalid (e.g., an unsupported protocol ID).
 *                 WLBS_NOT_FOUND, if NLB was not bound to the specified adapter (identified by server IP address).
 *                 WLBS_FAILURE, if a non-specific error occurred.
 * Returns: DWORD - a Win32 error code, ERROR_SUCCESS, if successful.
 * Notes:

/* 
 * Function: WlbsCancelConnectionNotify
 * Description: This thread safe function cleans up state maintained in the dll
 *              to support connection/session notifications to the NLB driver.
 *              The only usage constraint is that this API function must be the
 *              last notification call made by (any thread in) the process.
 *              Note that it is legal to cancel notifications then reestablish
 *              them within the lifetime of a thread of control.
 * Parameters: NONE
 * Returns: DWORD - a Win32 error code, ERROR_SUCCESS, if successful. No correction
 *                  action is needed if this call fails as it makes best effort.
 * Notes:
